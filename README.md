# What?

This is a clone of the Web word game Wordle for the Dutch language using nothing but plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# Why?

This was inspired by my spite at how I could not find a version of Wordle in Dutch that considers “Ĳ” to be one letter, as it is treated in capitalization (e.g. “Ĳsbeer”, not “Ijsbeer”) and in crossword puzzles.

For English speakers, “ĳ” often appears:
* where a “long I” sound does in English (**i**ce bear ↔ ***ĳ**sbeer*, Fr**i**day ↔ *vr**ĳ**dag*)
* where a “Y ending” does in English (lotter**y** ↔ *loter**ĳ***)
* in the *-lĳk* adjective or adverb ending, cognate to English *-ly* (man**ly** ↔ *manne**lĳk***), but used more often (royal ↔ *konink**lĳk***—cognate to “kingly”)

As I am by no means fluent in Dutch, I welcome proofreading and corrections for the text in the game.
