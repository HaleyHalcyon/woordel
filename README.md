This is a clone of the Web word game Wordle for the Dutch language using nothing but plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
This was inspired by my spite at how I could not find a version of Wordle in Dutch that considers “Ĳ” to be one letter, as it is treated in capitalization (e.g. “Ĳsbeer”, not “Ijsbeer”) and in crossword puzzles.
