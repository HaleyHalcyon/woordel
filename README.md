# What?

This is a clone of the Web word game Wordle for the Dutch language using nothing but plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# Why?

This was inspired by my spite at how I could not find a version of Wordle in Dutch that considers “Ĳ” to be one letter, as it is treated in capitalization (e.g. “Ĳsbeer”, not “Ijsbeer”) and in crossword puzzles.

For English speakers, “ĳ” often corresponds to a “long I” sound in English (**i**ce bear ↔ ***ĳ**sbeer*, Fr**i**day ↔ *vr**ĳ**dag*), or a “Y ending” in English (lotter**y** ↔ *loter**ĳ***).

# Licence

You are free to fork the repository and make a version of this game in a different language.

You are NOT allowed to feed the code and surrounding content (e.g. Issues and Pull Requests) to a machine learning model. (i.e. no AI scraping)

# Contribute

As I am by no means fluent in Dutch, I welcome proofreading and corrections for the text in the game.
